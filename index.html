			<p>We now have a launch date for the <span>Samsung Galaxy S22</span>. So expect rumors about Samsung's next phone to really heat up in the next two weeks.</p>
			<p>Then again, we've already got a pretty good idea of what <span>Samsung</span> has planned for its flagship phone lineup, thanks to everything that's leaked out so far.<br>And that's well in advance of the next <span>Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2022</span> event taking place in early February.</p>
			<p class="text-block1-p">One of the most compelling rumors is that the <span>Galaxy S22 Ultra</span> will be a successor to the Galaxy Note. That means we could see an integrated S Pen along<br>with a wider display and squared-off design.</p>

			<p>And across the <span>Galaxy S22</span> line, we're expecting camera upgrades, a new chipset, refined design and more. Such upgrades will be rather welcome. While our <span>Samsung Galaxy S21</span> review was largely positive, shoppers didn't seem all that excited about Samsung's three flagship phones.</p>

			<p>Since we're getting closer to the <span>Galaxy S22</span> launch, we're now seeing the first alleged live photos of the Galaxy S22. The back of the leaked image shows a Contour Cut camera that's less pronounced, which is a good thing.</p>
			<p>Other photos of what's likely the Galaxy S22 lineup show the same look for both the <span>Galaxy S22</span> and <span>Galaxy S22 Plus</span>. Both appear to be an evolution of the S21's design with the camera module sporting clear casing that holds a trio of cameras. Given the S21 was one of the more attractive phones of 2021, iterating on this with the Galaxy S22 and S22 Plus is no bad thing.</p>
			<p class="text-block3-p">Last year, while the <span>Galaxy S21 Plus</span> and Ultra had glass backs, the standard S21 used a plastic back. That seems to be changing for the Galaxy S22 series though, with leaker Ice Universe claiming all three phones will have glass bodies.</p>

			<p>The main chip powering the Galaxy S22 could be the just unveiled Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. In fact, a rumor that circulated before Qualcomm revealed its new chipset claimed that Samsung could be the company to manufacture the new Snapdragon chip.</p>
			<p>A benchmark for a Galaxy S22 Plus has been discovered using the next-gen Snapdragon chip. The results don't look too hot compared to currently available phones, but we'd imagine the scores will increase as Samsung does some final tweaking to the phone before launch. For what it's worth, Qualcomm says that the Kryo CPU in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is 20% faster than its predecessor with 30% more power savings. The Adreno GPU is supposed to boost speed by 30% while being 25% more efficient in terms of power consumption.</p>
			<p>As for rumors about RAM, the vanilla S22 and S22 Pro may use 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, while the S22 Ultra will have a choice between 12GB and 16GB of RAM, and 256GB and 512GB of storage. One leak says that the Galaxy S22 Ultra will come in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB options, paired with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM.</p>
			<p class="text-block4-p">Another tipster offers different storage options for the Galaxy S22 models. The Galaxy S22 and S22 Plus would come in 128GB and 256GB versions in this rumor, while the S22 Ultra would include a 512GB version as well. And as we mentioned, there's rumors of a 1TB option for the Galaxy S22 Ultra.</p>
